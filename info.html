                The Northeast Project is China’s national research project on the Northeast frontier that presents
                all the history developed within the current Chinese border as Chinese. This project includes China’s plan 
                to incorporate some of ancient Korean history into its own. China decided to carry out research on the Northeast  
                Project in June 2001,and after an eight-month preparation period, it received government approval on February 18
                the following year and officially began to promote the Northeast Project. The project was carried out with a
                five-year project with a deadline in 2006, but has been under way so far, and has recently claimed that the history
                and culture of the Korean Peninsula, including the old Goguryeo and Balhae regions, belong to China.

                <p class="detail2"> 
                    China is a multiethnic state officially composed of 56 ethnic groups, with the dominant group being the Han and
                    55 other groups forming minorities. The sole governing political party, the Communist Party of China, retains
                    control over the minorities; however, the embracement of free-market economics has slowly weakened the central 
                    authority.The government began to devise measures to prevent the fragmentation of the country, and the Northeast
                    Project is one of them. The Chinese government was interested in implementing any possible action to avoid secessionist
                    tendencies among the residents of the Three Northeast Provinces. Most of the residents are Ethnic Koreans, also known
                    as the Chaoxian group. Ethnic Koreans have some particular characteristics that distinguish them from the Han and the 
                    other minorities in many aspects. The Chaoxian characteristics include having a relatively short history of living in
                    China and having a neighboring country where people speak the same language. Therefore, by systemically claiming the 
                    ancient Korean history that happened over the Three Northeast Provinces as its own via the Northeast Project, the Chinese 
                    government now attempts to stabilize and prevent the fragmentation of those areas.

                <p class="detail2"> 
                    China’s Northeast Project currently goes even further than merely incorporating ancient Korean history into its own and 
                    shows its ambition to absorb Korean history and culture irrelevant to the Northeast region. Due to this reason, the Korean 
                    media outlets now use the term for a wide range of actions and often modify the term to explain the issue better. For example, 
                    China’s claim of kimchi as its own was covered as the Kimchi Project by the media. By assimilating Korean culture, China is assuming
                     to take advantage of Hallyu, the phenomenon that refers to the growth in global popularity and consumption of Korean culture. 
                     Indeed, assets that contain a high cultural and economic value, such as kimchi, appear to be of particular interest to the 
                     Chinese government. The hanbok is another example. Through Hallyu contents like the drama series Kingdom, the traditional 
                     Korean clothing, the hanbok, has drawn global attention, and now China claims that the hanbok originated from China’s Ming Dynasty. 
                     As seen from these cases, it is evident that, on a national approach, China now attempts to exploit the value of key Korean cultural 
                     assets by absorbing particularly popular Korean culture.

            <h1 class="info3">China's Use of Korean Contents</h1>
            <p class="detail1"> 
                As China utilizes the media in spreading the Northeast Project, the South Korean government must engage in a 
                counterattack by actively using the power of Hallyu contents. Currently, Hallyu contents are making remarkable
                 achievements in global markets. For instance, many of Korean Netflix’s original series, such as Kingdom and Sweet Home, 
                 has ranked in the Top 10 in many different countries. Under the influence of these contents, the national image of Korea 
                 is well promoted around the world. Therefore, the government must take advantage of them regarding diplomatic issues like 
                 the Northeast Project. In fact, when Chinese netizens were filled with outrage over BTS leader RM’s acceptance speech of 
                 the James A. Van Fleet Award, foreign newspapers criticized China’s biased historical account, helping people understand 
                 how serious the issue is. This incident proved the positive influence of Hallyu. The South Korean government needs to 
                 systematically use this power to form positive public opinion and gain international support about the Northeast Project issue.
